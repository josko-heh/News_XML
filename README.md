(15, 'The remarkable power of the prickly pear', 'A stalwart of the Mexican landscape is finding a second life powering up buildings in the desert, and it is proving to be an unusually sustainable biofuel.', 'T\r\nThe landscape could be one straight from a postcard of a Mexican desert. With strong sun almost directly overhead, a green field of cacti cover the dusty surroundings of Camémbaro, a farming community in the state of Michoacan. Nopal, as this type of oval-leafed plant is known all over the country, does not only grow in these lands. Also known as the prickly pear, it can be found all over the Mesoamerican region and it is so emblematic that it has a prime spot on Mexico’s national flag. It is regularly consumed as salad or in healthy shakes, or in less virtuous tortillas and nacho chips. The inedible waste products are normally discarded but in this town, after the cactus had given all it can as a food, people saw the potential of turning this waste into a new fuel source.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, local businessman Rogelio Sosa Lopez had already succeeded in the corn-made tortilla industry and partnered with Miguel Angel Ake to found Nopalimex, a company that grows cacti as a cheaper alternative to corn. They found that nopal crops produce between 300 and 400 tonnes of biomass per hectare in less fertile lands, and up to 800-1,000 tonnes in richer soils. Nopal also requires minimum water consumption and its waste, if properly processed, can be turned into biofuel.\r\n\r\n“We are sowing nopal for three reasons. The first one is social – it creates jobs and prevents emigration. Secondly, from an economic perspective, it reduces the cost of industrial processing of nopal-based products. Lastly and most importantly, there is an environmental reason,” says Ake. The hope is that biofuel from nopal can be a viable alternative to fossil fuels in the region.', '../images/p08dtm4m.jpg', 4, 'Robert Plant', 0, '2020-05-27', '2020-05-27 21:35:09'),

But it’s not always that simple.', 'S\r\nSuddenly we are all being told to plant trees. The hope is that they will save us from the worst effects of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe idea is everywhere. The Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has made a film arguing for extra protections for the world’s forests, and for the replanting of those that have been cut down. George Monbiot, a columnist in the UK’s Guardian newspaper, has founded a campaign called Natural Climate Solutions, which advocates restoring forests and other ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis is not just talk. The UK government has planted millions of trees over the last decade, and has pledged another million between 2020 and 2024. Others have attempted far more dramatic feats: in 2016 one Indian state planted 50 million trees in one day, while in July last year Ethiopia claimed to have planted 350 million in a day. Even the UK’s Daily Mail, a right-wing newspaper not known for its climate activism, has just launched a campaign encouraging all its readers to plant a tree. The underlying problem is that our society is releasing greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), that are warming the Earth’s climate to levels we have never experienced before. As a result the great ice sheets are melting, contributing to rising seas, and extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts are becoming more severe.', '../images/p08dsqlj.jpg', 4, 'Robert Plant', 0, '2020-05-27', '2020-05-27 21:36:54'),

Although this may have reduced our chances of being exposed to coronavirus, it may have had a less obvious effect on our immune systems by leaving us more vulnerable to other infections.\r\n\r\nHumans evolved on a planet with a 24-hour cycle of light and dark, and our bodies are set up to work in partnership with sunlight. One of the most obvious examples of this is the production of vitamin D in the skin in response to UVB exposure. This daily dose of vitamin D can help to strengthen our bones and teeth, but it also has an effect on our immune cells.\r\n\r\nVitamin D enables the macrophages in our lungs – a first line of defence against respiratory infections – to spew out an antimicrobial peptide called cathelicidin, killing bacteria and viruses directly. It also tweaks the activity of other immune cells, such as B and T cells, which orchestrate longer-term responses. People with low levels of vitamin D are at greater risk of viral respiratory tract infections such as influenza.', '../images/p08dtg2m.jpg', 4, 'Robert Plant', 0, '2020-05-27', '2020-05-27 21:37:58'),

This is a fast-moving contagion, borne of our 21st-Century globalised society, and it calls for the very latest evidence-based science. On this, we all agree, because we’re rational 21st-Century people, right?\r\n\r\nOnly up to a point. Surveys of the American public reveal that attitudes towards the same fatal virus in the same nation are strongly influenced by partisan voting patterns. Republican voters are generally less concerned than Democrats about Covid-19, and less likely to support public lockdown measures to prevent spread of the coronavirus, which at the time of publishing had infected over a million Americans and killed more than 69,000 people there.\r\n\r\nSince Covid-19 is an infectious disease, it depends entirely on human hosts to carry and spread it – the more people act as regular socialising humans, the more chances the virus has to replicate and spread, and the worse the epidemic. That’s the science. Only by recognising the threat of the disease, will people be mobilised to change their innate social behaviours, to actively slow its spread. However, while scientific and medical experts in the US and around the world alert the public to the risks, and reiterate the importance of social distancing, several global leaders, with no scientific training, have spent months playing down the risks.\r\n\r\nProtective movement restrictions have nevertheless been ordered by most state governments, with resulting business shutdowns and record unemployment. In response, more than a dozen states have seen anti-lockdown protests, as thousands of conservative and far-right Americans demand the restrictions are lifted, in spite of the health costs. In Michigan and Washington, pro-Trump, gun-toting protestors called for “liberty” from the “tyranny” of state governors. In their support, President Donald Trump tweeted “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “LIBERATE VIRGINIA!”, and described the protesters as people who “love our country”.', '../images/p08cbp98.jpg', 4, 'Robert Plant', 1, '2020-05-27', '2020-05-27 21:38:45'),

Today’s shows go through as much planning as any set at the Grammys or Oscars.\r\n\r\nThis year, Shakira and Jennifer Lopez are gracing the stage at the Hard Rock Stadium at Miami Gardens in Florida. Ostensibly, the crowd are there to see the game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs at Super Bowl LIV, but sometimes the few minutes of music designed for half-time entertainment linger longer in the memory than the games themselves.\r\n\r\nHere, BBC Music looks at 10 of the most memorable performances.\r\nOK, pub quiz music round time. Can you name the opening song that Jessica Simpson introduced the proceedings to? What song had its name rechanged to namecheck P Diddy? Name either of Kid Rock’s two numbers? Nope, us neither. That’s because what became the most famous halftime show of all time was overshadowed by a mishap that birthed a whole new phrase in the English language: “wardrobe malfunction”.', '../images/p081wh9n.jpg', 2, 'Robert Plant', 0, '2020-05-27', '2020-05-27 21:51:31'),
(21, 'The German rapper taking aim at entrenched racism', 'OG Keemo is a Sudanese-German rapper who has caused controversy by holding a mirror up to the racism that still exists in Europe’s most powerful economy.', 'O\r\nOn 5 September, the day that German rapper OG Keemo released his new single 216, his Twitter timeline was headed by a retweet of one of his idols, American MC Earl Sweatshirt: “I guess this the part where white people call me racist for being pro black,” followed by the shrug emoji. A self-fulfilling prophecy, as it turned out.\r\n\r\nFor the next five days, in which Keemo’s song and its accompanying, brutal visuals sent ripples through the German rap scene, his notoriously funny Twitter feed kept quiet. Apparently, the track’s explicit imagery of everyday racism, black pride, self-hatred, and racial profiling left some feeling personally attacked. \r\n\r\n“I wish I wasn\'t the type of guy to read YouTube comments,” OG Keemo says, laughing. “People think because those themes don\'t directly affect them, they simply don\'t exist. I knew some people would get upset. But I never thought I would get called a full-blown racist for addressing their inherent racism.”  \r\n\r\nSince appearing on the scene in 2017, OG Keemo has been somewhat of an outlier in the current German rap landscape. The son of a Sudanese man who came to Germany in 1990, the 26-year-old is heralded as the future, mixing his thoughtful lyrics with street sensibilities. Growing up in the mid-90s between the southwestern cities of Mainz, Heidelberg and Mannheim (where he still resides today), Keemo was raised on a diet of Sade, Nelly, Coltrane and 50 Cent’s Get Rich or Die Tryin’.\r\n\r\nStoic cool\r\n\r\nStylistically, he is an MC of the post-everything ilk who has mastered rap as a native language in itself; the kind that makes you wonder how people could have ever struggled to hold a beat or find clean, multi-syllabic rhymes for every curse word in the dictionary. His musical tastes and his rapping abilities are truly advanced.', '../images/p07s22nl.jpg', 2, 'Robert Plant', 0, '2020-05-27', '2020-05-27 21:52:24');<br/>
